# files

## main.py
Contains the parser, use this to run experiments

## deepfool.py
Checks the adversarial score of a model

## model.py
Contains model architectures : classifier, VAEs

## train_test.py
Trains and evaluates the models and prints the report

## utils.py
Various functions

## augmented_datasets folder (generated by main.py)
each dataset has its own folder, containing a bunch of .npy files:
- vae_latent_codes: the latent codes of the train set, obtained using the VAE's encoder

## trained_models folder (generated by main.py)
contains the parameters for all the trained models (TODO add more details)

## stylegan3-editing-cifar10
